# Hi there üëã
  My name is as what you can see from the left: Rionne Angelo Ugale. I am aspiring to become a computer engineer, though not really sure what specific field to take as of writing. Although my current skills bring me more closer to software programming, I know I can also excel in hardware programming and my gaze tends to point over there more. Besides this degree, I also want to take take other several undergraduate courses, not to mention that I will also take graduate courses, such as the following:
  - BA (and MA, if possible) in Digital Film (target school: University of the Philippines - Diliman)
  - MS (and PhD, if possible) in CPE (target: University of the Philippines - Diliman and/or Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
  - BS in Computer Science

### Other things about me:
- üè´ I'm currently a computer engineering student at **Mapua University**.
- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on my own version of our entry in the previous 2020 Blue Hacks Hackathon organized by Compsat.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: It is pronounced as **"ree-yon"** and not "ra-yon"
